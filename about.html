                        Manage Your Life was born from a personal problem: the difficulty of organizing my life using Excel spreadsheets, manual calculations, and fragmented controls. From this real need, I decided to create a digital solution capable of centralizing information, automating calculations, and providing a clear and objective view of personal organization and productivity. <br>

                        My name is Yan Felipe Rodrigues Vieira. I am a Brazilian Software Engineering student and a developer focused on back-end, an area I became passionate about after realizing the power of programming to solve real problems efficiently and at scale. <br>

                        My specialization is in Python and Django, technologies I mainly use in the development of systems, automations, and web solutions. Despite my focus on back-end, I have also acquired front-end knowledge — such as HTML and CSS, as well as basic JavaScript — to have autonomy in creating my own pages and complete applications. <br>

                        I have experience solving real problems in professional environments, especially through automation, always aiming to optimize processes, reduce manual work, and increase efficiency. I work with Git, have advanced English skills, and am constantly learning, keeping up with technological evolution and improving my technical skills. <br>

                        My main goal is to found my own technology company, focused on developing digital solutions through programming — well-structured, functional systems designed to generate real impact in the lives of people and businesses.
